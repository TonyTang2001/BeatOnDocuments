**Beat On** is a lightweight music app on Apple's platforms. Removing burdensome UI layers between the user and their beloved tunes, **Beat On** reimagines how imperceptible an app can be, just for the maximum enjoyment of beats.

**Beat On** is a software application developed and owned by its developer [TonyTang](https://github.com/TonyTang2001). **Beat On** is currently a free software application distributed through the App Store owned and operated by [Apple](https://www.apple.com). All users are not required to pay, or exchange any goods, for the development, distribution, and usage in the lifecycle of this software application.

However, it is highly encouraged to provide bug reports, usability feedbacks, and functionality advice to help improve **Beat On** and leverage its user experience for all. Pipelines for doing so include App Store rating and reviews, developer's contact, and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TonyTang2001/BeatOnDocuments/issues). Thank you!
