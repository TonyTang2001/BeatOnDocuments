**Beat On** is a lightweight music app on Apple's platforms. Removing burdensome UI layers between the user and their beloved tunes, **Beat On** reimagines how imperceptible an app can be, just for the maximum enjoyment of beats.

## Open Source

**Beat On** is an unexceptionable app, but it probably wouldn't be so great without the amazing work by some of the most talented developers in the community.

### Alamofire
[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) is an HTTP networking library written in Swift. 

Its outstanding performance and network heavy-lifting helps Beat On to construct a solid network foundation.

### Kingfisher
[Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) is a powerful, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web. It provides you a chance to use a pure-Swift way to work with remote images in your next app.

Its versatile and adaptive downloading and caching framework helps Beat On to present artwork images more efficiently and as power-saving as possible.

### SwiftyJSON
[SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) makes it easy to deal with JSON data in Swift.

Its flexibility makes dealing with network APIs a breeze, accelerates Beat On's development significantly.

### HummingKit
[HummingKit](https://github.com/TonyTang2001/HummingKit) is an SDK designed to ease the use of [Apple Music API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi). Written in Swift 5.2, HummingKit takes advantage of Swift's outstanding performance and latest features, offering an approachable entry for developers dealing with the Apple Music API.

It ensures a reliable layer between Apple Music API and UI/UX development of Beat On.
